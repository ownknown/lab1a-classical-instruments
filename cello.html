<p>The violoncello, usually abbreviated to cello, or 'cello (the c is pronounced as in the ch of "check"), is a bowed stringed instrument, a member of the violin family. A person who plays a cello is called a cellist. The cello is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, and as a member of the string section of an orchestra.</p>

<p>The name cello (plural: cellos or celli) is an abbreviation of the Italian violoncello, which means "little violone", referring not to the double bass but to the slightly larger (and now uncommon) instrument (bass violin, basse de violon) tuned a whole step lower than the cello.</p>

<p>The cello is most closely associated with European classical music. It is part of the standard orchestra and is the bass voice of the string quartet, as well as being part of many other chamber groups. A large number of concertos and sonatas have been written for it. It is less common in popular music, but is sometimes featured in pop and rock recordings. The cello has also been modified for Indian classical music by Saskia Rao-de Haas.</p>

<p>Among the most famous Baroque works for the cello are J. S. Bach's six unaccompanied Suites. In the Classical era the two concertos by Joseph Haydn in C major and D major stand out. Romantic era repertoire includes the Concerto by Antonín Dvorák, Elgar's Cello Concerto in E minor, and the two sonatas by Brahms. Compositions from the early 20th century include unaccompanied cello sonatas by Zoltán Kodály (Op.8) and Paul Hindemith (Op.25). The cello's versatility made it popular with composers in the mid- to late twentieth century, encouraged by soloists who specialized in contemporary music (such as Siegfried Palm and Mstislav Rostropovich) commissioning from and collaborating with composers.</p>
